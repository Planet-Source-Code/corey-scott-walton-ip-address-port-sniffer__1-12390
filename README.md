### Description

This program is the opposite of my the other program I submitted (A port sniffer).

This program scans a range of IP addresses, such as 127.0.0.1 to 127.0.0.254, for servers running on a port of your choice, such as 4232. It is fairly fast, takes about 3 minutes to scan 254 addresses. It is a complete, working program, but it could use a little more speed. My other program (A port sniffer) has a good demonstation on how you'd go about speeding up the scan.

If you like this code, please vote for it, thanx! :)
 
### More Info
 
This program, after compiled, may trigger McAfee to think it's a virus. You can examine the code though, it is legitimate.
